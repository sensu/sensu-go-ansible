      release_summary: |
        Be kind

        The main thing in this release is a small adjustment of our code of
        conduct that is a bit more generic and less event-focused.

        Say hello to Amazon Linux and Windows

        As the title suggests, we worked hard to bring you two new supported
        platforms to the Sensu Go Ansible Colletions. And yes, all your

        Our little secret
        
        This release contains a few new modules that allow you to manage all
        things related to the Sensu Go secrets: from adding secrets providers
        to passing secrets to resources that know how to use them.
      minor_changes:
       - Add modules for managing Sensu Go secret providers.
       - Add modules for managing Sensu Go secrets.
       - Add support for secrets to pipe handler module.
       - Add support for secrets to check module.
       - Add support for secrets to mutator module.
    modules:
      - name: secret
        description: Manage Sensu Go secrets
        namespace: ""
      - name: secret_info

    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Self-signed security
        
        The primary focus of this release is to enable configuration of Sensu
        Go backends that use certificates that are not considered trusted when
        using system-provided CA bundle.
      minor_changes:
        - Allow modules to supply custom CA bundle for backend certificate
          validation or skip the validation entirely.
      bugfixes:
        - Expand documentation about the *check_hooks* parameter in the check
          module.
        - Explain how the resource name parameter is used and what invariants
          need to hold in order for the Sensu Go to consider it a valid name.

  1.4.2:
    release_date: "2020-07-02"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Break the fall

        There is really only one reason for this release: making sure user
        management works with Sensu Go 5.21.0 and newer. And while the
        upstream did break the API, we did not, so all your playbooks should
        function as nothing happened. We had to add a *bcrypt* dependency to
        our collection so make sure it is installed on hosts that will execute
        the user module.
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure check module is as idempotent as possible.
        - Make user module compatible with Sensu Go >= 5.21.0.

  1.4.1:
    release_date: "2020-06-25"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Maintenance is the name of the game
        
        There are no nothing earth-shattering changes in this release, just
        honest little bug fixes and compatibility improvements.

        **NOTE:** The *sensu.sensu_go.user* module currently **DOES NOT** work
        on Sensu Go 5.21.0 and later. This is a know issue that will be fixed
        as soon as the updated user-related backend API endpoints are
        documented.
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure event module always returns a predicted result.
        - Make user module fully-idempotent. Previous versions did not
          properly detect the password changes.
        - Use fully-qualified collection names in module documentation.
        - Ensure backend initialization properly reports changed state.
        - Make API key authentication work even for regular users with limited
          permissions.
        - Update the datastore module to cope with the minor API changes.

  1.4.0:
    release_date: "2020-04-30"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Keeping up with the world
        
        Main changes in this release are related to updates in the Sensu Go's
        web API that broke our change detection.
      minor_changes:
        - Add support for RHEL and CentOS 8.
      bugfixes:
        - Fix resource metadata comparison on Sensu Go 5.19.0 and newer.
        - Update entity comparator to handle new fields.

      release_summary: |
        Bug fixing galore
        
        This release makes it possible to use the *asset* module when
        replacing the deprecated, single-build assets that were created by
        means other than Ansible.
      bugfixes:
        - Do not die when encountering a deprecated asset format.
        - Update return value documentation for info modules.
        - Add Sensu Go 5.17.x and 5.18.x to the test suite and remove the
          unsupported versions (5.14.2 and lower).
        - Update the role metadata with proper platform markers.
        - Remove unsupported Ubuntu versions from the test suite.

  1.3.0:
    release_date: "2020-02-03"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Authenticating with style on Debian
        
        Sensu Go 5.15.0 gained an API key authentication method and the
        Ansible collection finally caught up. This means that we can now
        replace *user* and *password* authentication parameters with a single
        *api_key* value.
       
        And the other big news is the addition of Debian support to the
        `install` role.
      minor_changes:
        - Add API key authentication support.
        - Add support for Debian installation.

      release_summary: |
        Building support for builds

        This release adds support for specifying builds when installing
        various Sensu Go components.
      minor_changes:
        - Add *build* variable to the *install* role that further pins down
          the package version that gets installed.

  1.1.1:
    release_date: "2020-01-08"
    changes:
      release_summary: |
        Python 2 is Still a Thing

        This is a bugfix release that makes sure the Sensu collection is
        working when Ansible control node uses Python 2.
      minor_changes:
        - Add support for RHEL 7 to the install role (thanks, @danragnar).
      bugfixes:
        - Accept *str* and *unicode* instance as a valid string in
          *bonsai_asset* action plugin.

        Hello Sensu Go 5.16

        This is the first release that supports installing Sensu Go 5.16.
      minor_changes:
        - Support for Sensu Go 5.16 initialization in backend role.
        - Support for external datastore management using *datastore* and
          *datastore_info* modules.
      bugfixes:
        - Reintroduce namespace support to *bonsai_asset* module (thanks,
          @jakeo)

        Rising From The Ashes

        This is the initial stable release of the Sensu Go Ansible Collection.
        It contains roles for installing and configuring Sensu Go backends and
        agents and a set of modules for managing Sensu Go resources.

        Where does the release name comes from? We took an existing Ansible
        Collection that @flowerysong wrote, gave it a thorough tune-up and
        added a comprehensive test suite. And now, it is ready to face the
        world!
